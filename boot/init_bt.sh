# start BNEP network accessing an existing PAN
# Instead of pairing from P4wnP1 to the device, which provides the NAP, the device
# has to pair to us and we use the provided PAN afterwards (connect to it and receive an
# IP configuration via DHCP). This has two advantages:
#	1) We don't need to interactively handle PASSKEYs or PINs, which would
#	be the case if pairing is initiated from P4wnP1
#	2) We don't need to know or discover the MAC of the remote device, as we simply
#	use the NAP feature of the devices which pairs to us
#
# This is an uncommon approach, as typically the device which provide the NAP
# (bluetooth tethering) receives the pairing request and after successful pairing
# is connected by the remote device (which is P4wnP1 in this case). Anyway, it has 
# been tested with to androids and is working, IF THE FOLLOWING POINTS ARE REGARDED (ANDROID):
#
#	0) Pre Step: If P4wnP1 is already in the list of paired devices of the Android phone, it has to
#	be removed first !!!!
# 	1) Enable bluetooth on Android
#	2) Enable bluetooth tethering on Android to provide an Internet connection
#	3) Instead of waiting for a pairing request, scan for existing bluetooth devices
#	and pair with P4wnP1 when found !!!
#	4) P4wnP1 allows pairing to everyone (no PIN, no Access Key). The Pairing initiated
#	from the android phone is combined with a "connect" from the Adroid phone, this
#	again allows P4wnP1 to connect to the provided Network Access Point, which should
#	be reflected from the phones UI (shortly after pairing succeeds).
#
#	Important: Once P4wnP1 is paired with the phone (and thus known) it isn't possible
#	to connect again (after a disconnect). This is because P4wnP1 provides no bluetooth services
#	which could be connected to when used as PAN user. This essentially means: to reproduce
#	the steps, P4wnP1 has to be removed from the phone's list of paired devices.
#	Pairing again involves the establishment of the needed device connection from the phones
#	end. 
#
#	Additional note: The logic of the NAP code, doesn't account for disconnects at the moment.
#	Thus to reestablih the NAP connection, once lost, P4wnP1 has to be rebooted.

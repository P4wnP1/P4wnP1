- calls to remote methods deliver boolean to indicate error + result (if client.callMethod is issued with deliverResult=True)
- if client disconnects, pending methods are set to error
- fixed issue on connection state reporting, when client times out
- fixed exception handling in core_create_process
- added pwd, ls and cd command for remote FS
- deployed a pass_trough handler, handing back data to the caller (mustn#t replace the default handler which prints out results)


ToDo: 
- add optional timeout to for remote method calls
- ls, pwd, cd need to check if client is connected before running

# P4wnP1 demo payload by MaMe82
# ==========================


# =============================
# USB setup
# =============================
# Make sure to change USB_PID if you enable different USB functionality in order
# to force Windows to enumerate the device again
USB_VID="0x1D6B"        # Vendor ID
USB_PID="0x0237"        # Product ID

USE_ECM=true            # kept enabled as fallback (could allow forwarding connection trough WiFi if added to payload)
USE_RNDIS=true          # kept enabled as fallback (could allow forwarding connection trough WiFi if added to payload)
USE_HID=false
USE_RAWHID=false        
USE_UMS=false

# disable setting of static routes for all IPv4 addresses
ROUTE_SPOOF=false

WIFI_ACCESSPOINT=true
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_NAME="P4wnP1"
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_PSK="MaMe82-P4wnP1"
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_IP="172.24.0.1" # IP used by P4wnP1
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
WIFI_ACCESSPOINT_DHCP_RANGE="172.24.0.2,172.24.0.100" # DHCP Server IP Range

WIFI_CLIENT_SSID="YourAPName" # name of target network
WIFI_CLIENT_PSK="YourAPPassword" # passphrase for target network

# The AutoSSH section enables a SSH reachback to a custom external SSH server
# working like this:
#   1) the target server is defined by AUTOSSH_REMOTE_HOST, the user by
#      AUTOSSH_REMOTE_USER
#   2) P4wnP1 continuously attempts to login to this SSH server, using the 
#      private key provided with AUTOSSH_PRIVATE_KEY
#   3) In order to allow the login to succeed, the user defined by AUTOSSH_REMOTE_USER
#      has to have the public key from AUTOSSH_PUBLIC_KEY present in his
#      ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file (the script P4wnP1_working_dir/ssh/pushkey.sh
#      can be used to help publishing the public key to the SSH server)
#   4) As soon as P4wnP1 is able to access the Internet (for example if the WIFI_CLIENT
#      connection succeeds and grants Internet access) the attempts to connect to 
#      the remote SSH server should succeed
#   5) On connection success, P4wnP1's SSH port 22 is forwarded to the
#      remote SSH server port given by AUTOSSH_REMOTE_PORT (only local host)
#   6) If you login in to the remote SSH server from a different device
#      you are able to connect back to P4wnP1 using
#	  ssh -p 8765 pi@localhost
#      
#      The port '8765' has to be replaced with the port configured
#      by AUTOSSH_REMOTE_PORT.
#
# Note: The public and private SSH key files used here, are generated
#       during P4wnP1 install and not packed into the P4wnP1 repo
#       (to assure a unique key pair).
#       If you want to (re)create a key pair, use the script in
#       `P4wnP1_working_dir/ssh/genkeys.sh
